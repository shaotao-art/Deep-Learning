# Deep Learning collection

this repo is my collection of deep learning, it includes many interest objects, including cnn architecture, attention and transformers, generative model, segmentation and detection... the main struct of the repo follows the standford's open course CS231n, it is a very nice course you may check it.

## present work
CNN arch:
1. AlexNet
2. VGG
3. GoogLeNet
4. ResNet

Generative model:
GANs:
1. simple GAN
2. DCGAN
3. Pix2Pix
4. CycleGAN

network understanding and visualization:

Segmentation:

Attention and transformers:
